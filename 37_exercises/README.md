** Habit Tracker

using the pixela api I created a small graph to track commits

I have written requests to create the user, the graph and then ones to add commits, delete commits, update commits

Further work would be to add an additional commit to a day instead of overwriting it.

This could likely be done with the get_pixel api and storing that value and then adding to it and finally updating it with a update_pixel api.
